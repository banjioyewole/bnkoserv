          <p>Historically, my primary discipline has been Computer Science, but I've done some other projects that I think are interesting too.

            I worked hard to make student government cool again while I was the Director of Marketing and Outreach for the Associated Students of the University of Puget Sound.

            I've worked with great people to design and build great services too, approaching the user experience with the same thorough consideration as the software used to create it. Using this approach we built many applications including a food delivery service for weekend delights and weekday staples.

            And for my university capstone in Computer Science, I made a drone fly autonomously with computer vision. </p>

          <p>All that and more is here as an archive of sorts for you to enjoy. </p>
